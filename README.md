# TeconmoonWiiVCInjector
Fork of the popular Wii Virtual Console Injector for Wii U by Teconmoon

The original can be found here:

Many little things were fixed.
Added support for NKIT (nkit.iso) and NASOS (iso.dec).

This isn't a complete rewrite though.
Source code is still SUPER CRAPPYâ„¢ as defined by the original author.
